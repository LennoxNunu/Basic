# We have created a headline news app.

Apple recommends we use the mvc architecture, but the mvc architecture has a controller class that tends to carry a large amount of code, which thereby  becomes very hard to keep track of the code. To solve this problem we will use the mvvm architecture to drastically reduce the amount of code found in the controller class.

In our main branch, we have a commit called mvc which shows the entire headline news app working with the mvc architecture. we also have a commit called mvvm which shows the entire headline news app working with the mvvm architecture.

Excluding the main branch, we have ten branches that are not directly related to the headline news. These branches explain the concepts of using the mvvm architecture.

All branches are listed below
<br><br/>
<br>0 main<br/>
<br>1 viewModelFromView<br/>
<br>2 displayingUsersInUITableView<br/>
<br>3 passingDataWithSague<br/>
<br>4 viewToViewModelBinding<br/>
<br>5 viewModelToViewBinding<br/>
<br>6 basicValidation<br/>
<br>7 ruleBasedValidation<br/>
<br>8 networkingLayer<br/>
<br>9 networkingLayerFromViewController<br/>
<br>10 networkingLayerFromViewModel<br/>
